# Patterns
ReactComponent = function(props) {
    const state = {}
    return <View>
}


reducers = (currentState = {}, action) => nextState

rootReducer = combineReducers({
    statePropName: reducerName
})

getSelector(subState, field, ...fields) => subState[field]

store = createStore(reducers)

store.dispatch(action) -> reducers()
